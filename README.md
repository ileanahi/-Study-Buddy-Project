# -Study-Buddy-Project
A project for "Grow With Google Scholarship 2018 Front-End Web Dev" fellow participants

Project Purposes:
* Learn GitHub workspace
* Learn to work as a team
* Create a test Project, consisting of individual pages from each member of the team
* Successfully combine our pages in a complete website
* Move on to making a real-life project for a third-party
* Share our results on Udacity GWG Forum

Project Rules:
* Name your branches that are not for testing, but to be included in the Project, after your nickname. E.g. mine is sophistique-chat
* To be continued (whatever can make us more comfortable here needs to be added to this Readme for future references)

Project Deadline:
* To be discussed

Current Participants:

If anybody from the rest of our team is registered here and wasn't added to the Collaborators list, please inform me using any convenient way.
